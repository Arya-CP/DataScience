Getting and Cleaning Data Project

submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

Overview:

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository

The following is a summary description of the project instructions:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory.
2. Load the datasets, activity and feature info
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
7. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
